% TODO: One para of closing discussion.
% - Results strongly suggest that RNTNs can encode the basics of this logic. First such result.
% -- Decay over size in recursion results not ideal, but this kind of behavior may not be problematic since there is a practical bound on the length of natural language sentences.
% - Future work: 
% -- Harder problems
% --- Sentences with more types of structure: Transitive verbs, relative clauses, etc.
% -- More models
% --- BP-RNNs, conv-RNNs
